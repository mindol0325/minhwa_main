# Portfolio Web Application

This simple Flask application lets you manage a personal portfolio of projects or study notes. It supports adding, editing, deleting and searching entries, and lets you upload an optional image for each item.

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python minhwa_main.py
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

Uploaded images are stored in `static/uploads/`.
